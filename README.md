# Iris-Dataset-EDA-and-ML
The purpose of this project is to analyze and model the Iris dataset. This is a simple dataset with somewhat easily separable classes. The dataset consists of four features describing three different types of Iris flowers. In this project I will:

- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Engineer new features
- Create a preprocessing pipeline
- Test several different ML algorithms
- Fine tune parameters
- Decide on the best model
- Note feature importances
- Save the model for future loading
